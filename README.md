# Advent of Code 2021

The following repository contains my work for the 2021 [Advent of Code competition.](https://adventofcode.com) My completion times and finishing places are listed below.  I only heard about the contest on December 1st which explains why my compeltion time for that day is so late. (or maybe I spent 22 hours learning how to iterate through an array)  

It should be noted that the code herein represents my attempts to code as fast as possible. The lack of commenting and the butchering of some data structures is a reflection of my attempts at speedcoding, not how I generally develop.
