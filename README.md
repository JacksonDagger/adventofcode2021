# Advent of Code 2021

The following repository contains my work for the 2021 [Advent of Code competition.](https://adventofcode.com) My completion times and finishing places are listed below.  I only heard about the contest on December 1st which explains why my compeltion time for that day is so late. (or maybe I spent 22 hours learning how to iterate through an array)
